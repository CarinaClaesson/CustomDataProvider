# CustomDataProvider
An example of a Custom Data Provider. Use a Custom Data Provider to connect to a data source and let data be displayed in Model-Driven Power Apps without having the data stored in the Common Data Service. Instead a Virtual Entity is used.

Visit my blog and you will find an example of using this Custom Data Provider.
